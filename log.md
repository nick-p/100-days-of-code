# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 04 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've set up my GitHub repo for 100 Days of Code. Started work on the Free Code Camp Random Quote Generator, the first Intermediate Front End Development project. I set up the basic page structure with a placeholder for the quote and buttons for Twitter and New Quote.

I attempted to copy the code from Cloud9 to GitHub but got an error on commit.

**Thoughts** I worked through a lot of Free Code Camp but hit a bit of a wall with the intermediate stuff. The indicative time for the 4 projects is 100 hours which matches nicely with 100 Days of Code. Today's work was basic, setting up the page structure with divs and doing a little bit of CSS, but it was good to see that I did it with minimal assistance. Getting into the actual coding part of it will be much harder.

I've also quickly become aware that I need to learn how to properly use GitHub, especially from the command line. The command line has always scared me a bit, but using GitHub through a GUI seems kind of limited and I think to get the best out of it, and properly understand what I'm doing, I need to embrace the command line.

As a bonus, updating this file is introducing me to Markdown, something that I've always thought would be useful to learn but have never been sure about what I would use it for.

**Evening update** I spent some more time trying to get to grips with GitHub. I looked at a tutorial for using Terminal but I think it's too much extra for me to try and understand right now. I had a play with GitHub desktop instead and I seem to be slowly becoming familiar with that. If I can get into a workflow of editor --> GitHub desktop --> GitHub repo I'll be happy.

### Day 2: January 09 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Yes, a gap of 5 days. Completely against the rules of not missing more than one day in a row. No real excuses, I probably could have found the time from somewhere. I'm not intending to leave another gap of this size but I'm not going to reset my progress every time I miss more than one day (which will happen again). I have come to relise that coding every day for 100 consecutive days is a huge ask for me - I could do it if I put everything else aside, but coding is more of a hobby than anything else for me. I've decided to alter the challenge a bit and do something coding related every day - so if I'm not actually writing code, I'll be reading a book or listening to podcasts, for example. This means I can get on with things when I'm away from the computer, and I'm far more likely to keep it up this way.

I did do some coding on Day 2. I started off with continuing the Random Quote Generator, but in revisiting JSON objects I realised I had an incomplete challenge from earlier in Free Code Camp, the Profile Lookup. This was part of the Basic Javascript challenges, related to getting the value of a specified property from a JS object. After a bit of playing around, and a couple of visits to Stack Overflow to read up on the hasOwnProperty method, the challenge was complete.

**Thoughts** I remembered a couple of previous times having looked at my Free Code Camp progress and having the Profile Lookup outstanding, so it was good to get it ticked off and the Basic Javascript section marked as complete. I remember struggling with that one for a while previously, but I seemed to understand it better this time round - even though I needed to use Read-Search-Ask (as encouraged by FCC) I knew what I was searching for and understood the answers that I found.

###Â Day 3: January 10 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I followed up on my change of tack by not doing any coding but instead reading some articles on Free Code Camp's Medium site. I started out reading a piece on the Ziegarnik Effect, in which a piece of work (e.g. code) is left unfinished in order to better understand it on resumption. I then followed this up by starting an in-depth piece on Flexbox - and following the previous piece's advice by stopping part way through, to resume tomorrow. 

**Thoughts** Flexbox is something I've heard about on many occasions, but never explored. The introductory sections I read today - while writing some very brief code samples - are very encouraging, and I've already seen how I can use it for the styling of my Random Quote Generator.
