~~**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

~~**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: January 04 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've set up my GitHub repo for 100 Days of Code. Started work on the Free Code Camp Random Quote Generator, the first Intermediate Front End Development project. I set up the basic page structure with a placeholder for the quote and buttons for Twitter and New Quote.

I attempted to copy the code from Cloud9 to GitHub but got an error on commit.

**Thoughts** I worked through a lot of Free Code Camp but hit a bit of a wall with the intermediate stuff. The indicative time for the 4 projects is 100 hours which matches nicely with 100 Days of Code. Today's work was basic, setting up the page structure with divs and doing a little bit of CSS, but it was good to see that I did it with minimal assistance. Getting into the actual coding part of it will be much harder.

I've also quickly become aware that I need to learn how to properly use GitHub, especially from the command line. The command line has always scared me a bit, but using GitHub through a GUI seems kind of limited and I think to get the best out of it, and properly understand what I'm doing, I need to embrace the command line.

As a bonus, updating this file is introducing me to Markdown, something that I've always thought would be useful to learn but have never been sure about what I would use it for.
